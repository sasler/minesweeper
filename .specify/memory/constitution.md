# Minesweeper Constitution

## Core Principles

### Faithful Minesweeper Gameplay

- Every game MUST implement canonical Minesweeper rules: deterministic mine placement seeded per difficulty, accurate neighbor counts, and first-click safety on supported modes.
- Game outcomes MUST be reproducible for seeded boards and auditable via debug output that preserves grid state without revealing spoilers during play.
- Any enhancements (hints, undo, themes) MUST default to off and MUST NOT alter scoring, timer behavior, or win/loss validation.

Rationale: Players expect authentic Minesweeper behavior; deviations erode trust and invalidate leaderboard comparisons.

### Clean Responsive UI

- UI layouts MUST adapt fluidly from 320px-wide handsets to large desktop viewports without horizontal scrolling or clipped components.
- Visual hierarchy MUST highlight the board, timer, mine counter, and status indicators using consistent spacing, typography, and theming.
- Animations and transitions MUST be subtle, cancelable, and never block gameplay interactions.

Rationale: Responsive polish preserves usability across devices and keeps focus on core gameplay signals.

### Accessible Controls for Everyone

- Primary interactions MUST be operable via keyboard, pointer, and assistive technologies (e.g., ARIA roles for cells, status updates via live regions).
- Color usage MUST pass WCAG 2.1 AA contrast for all states, with alternative signifiers (icons, patterns) for mined/flagged/safe cells.
- Input feedback (hover, press, error) MUST announce state changes without relying solely on color or sound.

Rationale: Minesweeper’s grid demands precise input; accessibility guarantees everyone can participate reliably.

### Maintainable Codebase Discipline

- Code MUST be modular, covered by automated tests for board generation, state transitions, and UI logic, and documented where behavior is non-obvious.
- Architectural decisions MUST favor composable components, predictable state management, and continuous lint/test enforcement in CI.
- Dependencies MUST be minimal, version pinned, and reviewed quarterly to prevent supply-chain drift.

Rationale: Sustainable engineering lets the team evolve gameplay without regressions or brittle coupling.

### Smooth Cross-Device Performance

- Gameplay interactions MUST respond within 100ms on modern hardware, with rendering holding 60 FPS on desktop and 30 FPS on low-power devices.
- Asset loading MUST stay under 1 MB initial payload; subsequent downloads MUST be lazy-loaded and cached.
- Performance budgets (CPU, memory, input latency) MUST be measured per release with automated benchmarks in CI.

Rationale: Fast feedback maintains Minesweeper’s rhythm and keeps the experience dependable on any device.

## Experience Standards

- Difficulty presets MUST document board dimensions, mine counts, and timer/score rules; changes require user-facing release notes.
- UI assets (icons, typography, spacing tokens) MUST be sourced from a shared design system to preserve consistency with the Clean Responsive UI principle.
- Accessibility audits (WCAG AA) and performance metrics MUST be captured in release notes for each major update.

## Delivery Workflow Expectations

- Every feature plan MUST include a Constitution Check referencing each Core Principle, identifying risks and mitigation before implementation.
- Pull requests MUST link to automated test evidence: unit, accessibility (axe or equivalent), and performance benchmarks.
- Releases MUST include a regression checklist covering gameplay correctness, control accessibility, and performance budgets.

## Governance

- Amendments require consensus from maintainers plus one QA representative, documented via pull request with rationale and migration steps.
- Versioning follows semantic rules: MAJOR for principle changes/removals, MINOR for new principles or governance scope, PATCH for clarifications.
- Compliance reviews run quarterly; non-compliance MUST block releases until remediated or signed off with a remediation plan.
