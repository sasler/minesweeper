# Feature Specification: Modern Minesweeper Experience

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-modern`  
**Created**: 2025-09-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a modern Minesweeper game with a clean, responsive interface. The player selects a difficulty level, then clicks tiles to reveal numbers or mines. Revealing a mine ends the game. Empty tiles with no adjacent mines auto-reveal surrounding tiles. The first click is always safe. The game includes a timer, mine counter, and restart button."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Player lands on the start screen and selects Beginner, Intermediate, or Expert difficulty.
2. System seeds a Minesweeper board with canonical mine counts, guaranteeing the first revealed tile is safe.
3. Player reveals tiles via primary interaction, placing flags/question marks with alternate controls.
4. Empty tiles with zero adjacent mines trigger automatic flood reveal while preserving spoiler-free debugging data.
5. Timer, mine counter, and status indicator update in real time; loss on mine reveal, win when all safe tiles are uncovered.
6. Player may restart at any time, changing difficulty without navigating away.
7. Accessibility, responsiveness, and performance budgets are validated prior to release.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29

- Q: How should a player toggle flag/question markers on touch-only devices? → A: Use a persistent toggle button to switch between reveal and flag modes.

---

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- Deliver authentic Minesweeper gameplay that matches classic rules and supports canonical scoring expectations.
- Keep the board, timer, and mine counter visually prioritized on all viewports with unobtrusive chrome.
- Ensure keyboard, pointer, and assistive tech users can perform every action without degradation.
- Maintain fast load (≤1 MB initial payload) and snappy input feedback (<100 ms) even on low-power devices.
- Deliver the experience with semantic HTML, responsive CSS, and modular vanilla JavaScript (no external frameworks).

### Section Requirements

- Describe difficulty presets (board size, mine count) and how first-click safety is upheld.
- Document UI components (board grid, HUD, status messaging, restart controls) and their responsive behavior.
- Capture accessibility obligations (ARIA roles, focus order, live regions, color contrast) and validation methods.
- Define performance targets (input latency, frame rate, bundle size) per device class.

### For AI Generation

- Surface open questions for future phases if leaderboard integration, sound design, or theming become priorities.
- Flag any dependency on external services (analytics, telemetry, save data) if introduced later.
- Reuse this spec to drive Constitution Checks, ensuring every plan references gameplay fidelity, accessibility, and performance.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a casual player, I want to choose a difficulty, reveal tiles, and finish a Minesweeper board so that I can enjoy a quick, fair puzzle experience.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the player is on the start view, **When** they select Intermediate and tap a tile, **Then** the timer starts, the tile is safe on first reveal, and nearby numbers appear per classic rules.
2. **Given** a board with one mine left flagged, **When** the player reveals the final safe tile, **Then** the game declares a win, stops the timer, and surfaces restart and difficulty options.

### Edge Cases

- First click targets a mined coordinate: board must reshuffle or defer mine placement to keep the tile safe.
- Player rapidly double-clicks or long-presses multiple tiles: interactions queue without dropping frames or duplicate state transitions.
- Keyboard-only player cycles focus across tiles and HUD: arrow/Tab navigation, space/enter for reveal/flag, with live regions announcing state.
- Screen reader users receive concise updates for timer changes and mine counter without excessive chatter.
- Layout on 320 px wide devices keeps the grid fully visible via scaling or zoomed viewport with no horizontal scroll.
- Performance validation ensures input latency stays under 100 ms and frame rate meets 60 FPS desktop / 30 FPS low-power thresholds.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST present Beginner (9x9/10 mines), Intermediate (16x16/40 mines), and Expert (30x16/99 mines) selections before gameplay.
- **FR-002**: System MUST generate mine placement using deterministic seeding per difficulty while guaranteeing the first revealed tile is non-mined.
- **FR-003**: System MUST reveal numeric counts or mines consistent with classic Minesweeper rules and auto-flood adjacent empties.
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide flag and question mark mechanics with keyboard and pointer parity, including undoing markings, and MUST offer a persistent touch toggle between reveal and flag modes.
- **FR-005**: System MUST track and display an always-visible timer (mm:ss) that starts on first reveal and stops on win/loss.
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain a mine counter that recalculates when flags are placed or removed.
- **FR-007**: System MUST surface a restart control that resets the board while preserving difficulty selection and clears timer/counters.
- **FR-008**: UI MUST remain responsive across ≥320 px, ≥768 px, and ≥1024 px breakpoints without horizontal scroll or clipped HUD elements.
- **FR-009**: Experience MUST meet WCAG 2.1 AA, including 4.5:1 contrast, ARIA roles for tiles/status, focus indicators, and live announcements for game state.
- **FR-010**: Client MUST sustain ≤100 ms input latency for reveal/flag actions and maintain 60 FPS on desktop, 30 FPS on low-power devices under standard board sizes.
- **FR-011**: System MUST expose debug-friendly board state export for QA that does not leak spoilers during live play.

No outstanding clarification requests identified for this scope.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **GameSession**: Captures difficulty, board seed, timer state, mines remaining, game status (in-progress, won, lost).
- **Tile**: Holds coordinates, mine boolean, adjacent mine count, reveal state, flag/question status, accessibility label.
- **HUDMetrics**: Aggregates timer, mine counter, status text, and restart control state for display and live region updates.
- **InputAction**: Represents reveal, chord, flag, or restart commands with source (keyboard, pointer, assistive tech) for analytics and QA replay.
